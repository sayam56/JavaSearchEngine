# JavaSearchEngine
Simple Java Search Engine Using Jsoup

The purpose of this web search engine is to systematically look up URLs. The search engine begins crawling as soon as the user enters a specific URL for a search. After the crawling was complete, it began searching for the pattern that the user had entered. 

Afterwards, it identifies the specific word with the pattern using the Boyer-Moore algorithm. If a word appears in the crawled data, the number of occurrences, the source file name, and the website URL are displayed.

Additionally, it reveals the top 5 files that include the specific word that the individual searched for after sorting the data using merge sort.
