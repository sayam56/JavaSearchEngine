computer science degree at my local community college. my main challenge was finding a program that was affordable and offered more than one live online meeting per week. most bootcamps that did offer this were very expensive and required a full-time commitment, which wasn't feasible for me as a full-time employee on a tight budget.but one day, i received an email from w3school announcing their own bootcamp program. after doing some research, i was very impressed with their curriculum that covered everything you need to know to get started with web development. robyn johnson very interesting! the instructor is awesome! he really takes time to explain. i feel like everyone in the bootcamp but me understands the concepts, but the instructor always wipes away the imposter syndrome. i'm learning quickly, and we haven't even made a month yet. he makes sure to meet with you one on one to be sure you're understanding the task. he leads you to the answer instead of giving it to you, which helps builds confidence. this bootcamp is very affordable compared to others but doesn't lack in education. i'm extremely glad i found this bootcamp and look forward to being an official web dev
